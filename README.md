A pretty simple cpu simulator.

* 4 General Purpose Registers (GPRs) – each 16 bits in length
* 1 Index Register – 16 bits in length
* 16-bit words/2 8-bit bytes
* Memory of 16,384 words/32,768 bytes
* Two banks for the Memory
* Byte addressable
* One simple L1 cache, 8 lines with 8 words in each line.
